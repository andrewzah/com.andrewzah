I find my laptop's keyboard to be adequate, but I rarely enjoy using it for
longer periods. While I was in Tokyo, I figured I'd check out a keyboard store
for fun, and I saw this keyboard amongst a whole bunch of DIY kits.

## Initial Thoughts

I've owned the original HHKB (2?) in the past, so I'm familiar with its topre
keyswitches and alternate key layout. I think these are best tried in person as
they're not for everyone.

The bluetooth feature of this HHKB is well worth it. The build quality, as
usual, feels solid even though it's not made out of metal. I shouldn't have to
update this review much.

The only downside I see so far is that compared to the original HHKB, the
compartment for batteries (2x AA) adds some bulk.

I'm happy with this purchase. It's good to be on Topre keyswitches again.

## Update: 2 Months

The HHKB has held up as a daily driver, although I have some notes.

The batteries seem to get used up faster than I expected; I'm already on my 3rd
pair. After using the logitech k380 bluetooth keyboard, I got used to leaving
mine always on... however the standby mode of the HHKB seems to use more energy.

From time to time (this has happened about 3 times so far), the bluetooth
connection seems to degrade for no reason, adding a noticeable latency to
keystrokes. It's easily fixed by restarting the keyboard so it's not really an
issue.

## Info

I purchased this for JPY Â¥36,000 (USD $244.94), at
[Yusha Kobo Keyboard Speciality Shop](https://maps.app.goo.gl/v6NNsK27UTKbo86p9)
in Akihabara, Tokyo, on May 12, 2025.
