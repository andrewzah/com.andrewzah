Thinking of perusing used stores for retro handhelds like a Gameboy Advance or
3DS in Tokyo? Best spend your precious time doing something else. The era of
finding deals is over, at least for handhelds.

Prices for Gamecubes weren't as bad, likely as they're bulkier and less
in-demand. In fact I've picked up some OEM gamecube controllers for ~$25-30 USD
at bookoffs - in Tokyo, no less!
