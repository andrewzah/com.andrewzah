Listed roughly in order of importance. Let me know if I missed any important
ones!

If you live in Korea (and have a Korean bank account and phone plan), then see
my companion post,
[Useful Apps for Residents of South Korea](/posts/korea-resident-useful-apps).

## Essential

### Papago | 파파고

The picture to translation feature might be the most critical one here! To me
the English <-> Korean translations are much more natural than Google Translate.
(Japanese and Chinese, as well).

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to download your languages in advance!

### Naver Maps | 네이버 지도

The quality of Google and Apple Maps in Korea is terrible compared to Naver,
which is more or less the Google of Korea.

Luckily, the mobile apps support English now.

Hot Tip: If you're taking the train, Naver Maps will show which car will give
you the fastest exit at the transfer or destination station.

### Airalo

While most cafes in Seoul offer wifi, I prefer to not be stuck without data.

If your phone supports E-SIMs, you can skip dealing with the SIM vendors at the
airport. Airalo supports many countries; I've used it in Japan and Singapore as
well. Ubigi is a similar app.

> [!NOTE]
> Airalo and Ubigi are data-only plans. If you need to send and receive texts,
> get an E-SIM at the airport. This is because they need to verify your
> passport. Some apps like Coupang (item delivery) and 배달민원/Shuttle (food
> delivery) need a valid phone number. Sometimes they accept numbers from any
> country, so if you're using something like Verizon's Travel Pass then you
> should be fine.

## Misc.

### Instagram & Tiktok

These social sites are a great way to discover cafes and businesses to visit. Of
course, any place that's popular on Instagram/Tiktok is likely to have long
lines...

### KakaoTalk | 카카오톡

Kakaotalk is _the_ communication app in Korea. Since I come from the US, I was
really surprised people use this over, well, the built-in messaging apps... This
is also the case with Wechat in China and Line in Japan.

Hot Tip: You can have multiple profiles. This is handy if you join group chats
and don't want to divulge info from your main profile.

### Naver Dictionary | 네이버 사전

### Meetup

This lets you find or organize meetup groups. Although you need to pay for the
Pro plan to be able to make groups and host events.

In Seoul there are _plenty_ of language exchanges. The trick is finding a group
with lots of Koreans, as most of them are foreigner filled.

## Navigation

### Kakao Map | 카카오맵

Kakao Map is usually better for bikers. It'll show you which parts of the
journey are on the sidewalk or the main road.

### Ddareungi / Seoul Bike | 따릉이

Seoul offers a public bike rental service, with stations all over. You can find
a nearby bike and rent it for:

- 1 hour - 1,000 KRW - ~\$0.72 USD
- 2 hours - 2,000 KRW - ~\$1.43 USD
- all day - 5,000 KRW - ~\$3.58 USD

If you return the bike early, you can still use the remaining time, for up to 24
hours. You can also temporarily lock the bike if you need to go into a store,
for example.

Here's a more detailed article that shows
[how to rent a bike via 따릉이](https://creatrip.com/en/blog/7376).

### k.ride - taxi, cab, korea trip

A taxi app for foreigners. In my experience, Uber didn't work well. I've used
카카오T in the past, but I believe you need a Korean account now.

You can communicate with some pre-determined sentences that are translated for
the driver.

### Korail

If you're planning on taking Korea's KTX (bullet train), this app lets you see
timetables and purchase tickets. The iOS version is ...not great.

Note 1: If a train is sold out, you still may be able to get standing room, but
that is still in-person only at a KTX office.

Note 2: COME EARLY and double check the train number! If it's your first time at
the KTX area of Seoul Station, it can be a little confusing finding the right
platform.

## Shopping

### Coupang | 쿠팡

Coupang offers shopping with next-day delivery if you order early enough. The
downside is for food items, it's often x5 or x10 of whatever, not just 1 or 2.

You'll need a valid phone number, but any country should work.

> [!WARNING]
> Don't make an account. At the checkout, find the 해외 신용카드 (foreign credit
> card) option.

|
[Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coupang.mobile&hl=en_US)

### GMarket (global version)

GMarket is more similar to Amazon, with random vendors selling items. As such be
careful to analyze listings carefully.

The global version's catalogue is different.

| [Website](https://global.gmarket.co.kr/Home/Main)

## Food Delivery

### 배달민원

Food delivery at all hours! That's worth navigating an all-Korean interface!
You'll need a valid phone number, but nearly any country works.

> [!WARNING]
> Don't make an account. At the checkout, find the 해외 신용카드 (foreign credit
> card) option.

[iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/kr/app/%EB%B0%B0%EB%8B%AC%EC%9D%98%EB%AF%BC%EC%9B%90/id1456556467)
|
[Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hybrid.kicpc&hl=ko)

### Shuttle

Shuttle supports English and foreign credit cards, but the last time I used it,
the selection was not nearly as good as 배달민원 or 요기요.
