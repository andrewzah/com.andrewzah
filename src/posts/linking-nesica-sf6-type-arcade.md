If you're in Japan and are a fan of street fighter, I highly commend checking
out an arcade and setting up a Nesica card. On top of being a nice memento, it
comes with some quality of life features.

## what's this nesica card for anyway?

The main feature is matchmaking across arcades in Japan. Otherwise, you're stuck
to matches with people in the same cabinet block in your arcade.

There are some other nice features as well:

- viewing replays
- setting your own username instead of PLAYER019275
- setting your preferred character and color, to skip the selection process
- linking your purchased skins from your steam and PS5 accounts

## acquiring and setting up the nesica card

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The arcade cabinet and sf6ta website are all in Japanese, so I recommend using
> a translation app with a camera feature, like Papago or Google Translate.

1. Travel to an arcade in Japan that has a Street Fighter 6: Type Arcade
   cabinet. Examples: Taito in Akihabara, Shinjuku Sports Land, etc
1. Acquire a Nesica card from a vending machine. I believe it costs JPY ¥300
   (about $2 USD).
1. **Use the card at least once** to play the arcade mode or online. When you
   hold the card to the reader, the first question is asking if you want to use
   that card or not. Select Yes ("はい").
1. After using the card at least once, make a Nesica account at
   https://nesica.net and register your Nesica card using the serial on the back
   of it.
1. Visit https://sf6ta.jp/ and link your Nesica account.

### Linking your Steam/PS5 accounts

You can get the Link Code needed by opening Street Fighter 6, then open the menu
and it's under Option -> Game -> Display Type Arcade Link Code.

If you want to link your ps5/steam account and skins, click the Menu button and
then "連携コード", which is the last purple option. Follow the instructions on
that page to enter your Link Code.

### Character preferences & customization

Either click on the 'My Room VS Data' button or the 'Menu' button and then 'My
Room'. Use your browser's translate function or a translation app.
