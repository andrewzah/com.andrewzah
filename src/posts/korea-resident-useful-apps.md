This a list of apps aimed at people who live in Korea, and **have a phone plan
and bank account**. Although many apps have English these days, many do not. So
knowing enough Korean to navigate apps is expected as well.

Some apps are only available on the South Korean app store. Please see my
companion article on [how to make a korean apple account]().

Please check my companion post,
[Useful Apps for Travelers in South Korea](/posts/korea-travel-useful-apps) as
well.

Unlike Zillow in the US, these real estate apps are full of fake listings. I'm
_pretty_ sure it's intentional from realtors.

If you must, Naver 매물 or 공실박스.

In any case, the best way to find an apartment is to visit a 부동산
(Bu-dong-san, realtor) in person.
