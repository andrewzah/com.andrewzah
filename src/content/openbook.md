Following the
[Fakebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_sheet)
and
[Real Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Book),
I wanted to make a successor that (1) addresses the issues found in both,
and (2) is buildable from source.

The following pdfs are auto-generated using
[Lilypond](https://lilypond.org/), in Concert key and transposed for Eb and Bb.

* [Openbook (Concert).pdf](/openbook-Concert.pdf)
* [Openbook (Bb).pdf](/openbook-Bb.pdf)
* [Openbook (Eb).pdf](/openbook-Eb.pdf)
