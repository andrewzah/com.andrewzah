I generally find my laptop's keyboard to be adequate, but I rarely enjoy using it for longer periods.

A solid keyboard. Purchased for JPY Â¥36,000 at
[Yusha Kobo Keyboard Speciality Shop]() in Akihabara, Tokyo.

I've owned the original HHKB (2?) before, and the bluetooth feature of this one is excellent.
The build quality seems very similar (solid) - I shouldn't have to update this review much, knock on wood.

Downsides: Compared to the original HHKB, the module that presumably adds bluetooth functionality is bulky.
Maybe due to the 2 AAA batteries required?

Anyways, it's good to be on Topre keyswitches again.
