Welcome to my corner of the internet.
I'm a programmer by trade, and I'm fascinated by the world we inhabit.

My interests are mainly in programming and computer science, language learning, and fighting games,
although I dabble in many hobbies.

In person, I'm generally open to a coffee or coworking at a cafe, schedule permitting.
