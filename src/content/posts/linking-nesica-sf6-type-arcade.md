Note: The arcade cabinet and sf6ta website are all in japanese, so I recommend using
the google translate or papago app's camera feature.

1. Travel to an arcade in Japan that has a Street Fighter 6: Type Arcade cabinet.
  Examples: Taito in Akihabara, Shinjuku Sports Land, etc
1. Acquire a Nesica card from a vending unit. I believe it costs JPY ¥300.
1. Use the card at least once to play the arcade mode or online.
  a. When you hold the card to the reader, the first question is
    asking if you want to use that card or not.
    Select Yes ("はい") and put in a ¥100 coin or tap your IC card.
1. Make a Nesica account at https://nesica.net and register your Nesica card
  using the serial on the back of it.
1. (optional) Boot up Street Fighter 6, open the menu, and get your Link Code:
  Open the menu and it's under Option -> Game -> Display Type Arcade Link Code.
1. Visit https://sf6ta.jp/ and link your Nesica, then enter your Link Code.

## Why tho?

- you'll be able to find matches with people in other arcades across japan,
  not just whoever's in the same arcade cabinet block as you
- can view your replay ID history
- can set your own username
- can set your own match comments
- can set character preferences (e.g. lock in your main character automatically to save time)
- can use your skins if you link your PS5/Steam accounts
