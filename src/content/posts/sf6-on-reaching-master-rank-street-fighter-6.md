Just over a year and a half 's passed since
[Street Fighter 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter_6) came out.
It's been my first serious foray into the franchise- I've dabbled here and there
with
[Street Fighter III: Third Strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter_III:_3rd_Strike)
but went back to other games.

## Preface

Being my first real traditional fighter, I decided to play through the entirety
of World Tour (WT). WT functions as both the open-world story and the defacto
tutorial for SF6. There is a built in tutorial as well, but that's more of a
quick primer.

I recall finishing WT after about ~20-25? hours. My goal then was to start
honing a character to hop into online play.

## First Steps

Ryu and Ken appealed to me a bit since I like the shoto archetype, but watching
Nuckledu play Guile at CEO (the first SF6 tournament) sealed the deal. Guile is
a polarizing character due to his zoning and simple kit, but he just looked so
_stylish_.

So I started looking up some of his bread & butter combos (BnBs).

- talent vs. studies , grinding , training
- hours spent

Note that 1500MR is the default once you reach master rank.
